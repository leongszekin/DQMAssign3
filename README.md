## Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset

__1. Dataset Overview__

The Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset is a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arifmia/heart-attack-risk-dataset). 

- It contains 50,000 rows and 20 columns, capturing various attributes that may have effects on heart attack.

- It is a clean dataset without any null values. The key variable is Heart_Attack_Risk (Low, Moderate, High).

- It contains 2 "float64" columns, 7 "object" columns, and 11 "int64" columns. However, 7 out of 11 "int64" columns should be boolean columns. To analyze more conveniently, I converted 7 "int64" columns to "boolean" columns. 

Details can be found in the folder.

__2. Graphs of Dataset and Data Analysis__

Following the "Data Summary" section, five analyses were conducted to provide insights into the dataset. While heart attack risk may be influenced by various factors, these analyses focus on basic observations and patterns, without delving into causal relationships between specific elements and heart attack risks.

__3. How to Use__

Data analysts can refer to the steps for cleaning and analyzing data.

Healthcare staff can read the graphs and tables to learn about the related factors and data on heart attack risks.
